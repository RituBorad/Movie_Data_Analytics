### The Movie Database Analytics

- Companies using big data analytics are able to help filmmakers understand what about their movie will succeed and what will flop. Data analytics can be used at every life cycle stage of the movie, from development to post-production and distribution. Predictive analytics can help producers, production companies, and executives to inform strategic decision-making, predict trends, and better understand viewer habits.

- Dataset is collected from the TMDb data. The original data from Kaggle is cleaned and then used for this predictive analysis. It contains data for about 10000 movies icluding the movie cast, director, genre, popularity, budget, IMDb ratings, revenue etc.

- All the codes are developed in Python JupyterNotebook. Libraries used are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and MATPLOTLIB.

- After the predictive analysis, questions like these can be answered:

  1. Does higher budget mean higher popularity ? Is there a coefficent relationship ?
  2. Will the runtime affect the vote count and popularity?
  3. Higher popularity means higher profits ?
  4. What Features are Associate with Top 10 Revenue Movies ?
  5. Which genres are most popular from year to year?
